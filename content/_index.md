## I should write something here. 

Hello and welcome to my personal website! I'm Radim and you may be wondering what I'll be writing about here - honestly, I'm still figuring it out myself!

Expect an unpredictable mix of topics as I explore the world of writing, darker corners of the soul and share some twisted world views. Along the way there's a good chance you'll get lost in inner workings of my brain. You have been warned.

So, come along on this journey with me and navigate through the twists and turns of mind, let's see where this adventure takes us! But remember - don't feed the gremlins after midnight.
